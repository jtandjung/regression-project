# Linear Regression Modellin Project
Developed a multiple regression model to predict rental prices based off a San Francisco dataset provided by Udemy

## General Information
Linear regression is a cornerstone of data science and I thought that this practical project was good way to practice using regression techniques firsthand.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Statsmodels

## Room for Improvement
- More feature engineering could be done to explore whether the model could be more accurate
- A larger dataset from other sources can be cleaned and used to verify current model performance
